So its pretty much like you have an pickaxe in your inventory, thats what it starts out as, but when you right click it, it does the ability you set the hero too.
To change your hero, you do /hero or their is a sign in spawn but they both end up opening a gui with the option to change hero. But then with your ordinary
pickaxe, you wanna upgrade that too right. So their will be a special currency called Coins.

Ways to get coins:
When you rank up to next mine
First time you join the server
Buy them with real money
Send coins to each other (not sure about this yet)
Daily Rewards (plugin im buying from spigot so it should just be command based)
Mining Blocks
And Voting

Coin Commands:
/coins give [playername]  [amount]	(this is eco, so not transfer)
/coins take [playername] [amount]	(this is eco, so an eco way to take coins)
/coins send [playername] [amount]   (this is not eco, so you can give your coins to people)
/coins balance  (views the amount of coins you have)
/coins	( is the help center on what to do with your coins aka command center with list)

What you can do with your coins:
Use them to buy heroes
Gamble them in the casino (casino info will be below)
Use them to buy drinks for you and your friends
Upgrade your pickaxe
Rent a jail cell
Open Crates

Casino:
Players bet on a table 3x3 blocks that either become tnt or emerald block if they win or loose which the block should be configurable. Their will be a sign with the amount of coins you are betting. If you win you double your coins, if you loose you loose what you bet aka the table bet amount. So when you pull lever down it will say rolling.. And it will go from the 2 winning and loosing blocks and will stop at either one.

Jail cell:

So their will be jail cells, people can rent them. When it starts out people rent them with coins and the coins go to the server eco. You can also buy a jail cell but with real money, and then from their on that cell will be permanently yours unless your afk for a month. You can rent your sell out to people that wanna rent cells. So their will be a sign in your little jail cell and once clicked a gui will pop up with set prices and time. So like 1 hour, 5 hours 24h. Then once u decide which options their will be a sign infront of your cell saying how long for how much. But if its not for sale it will so Not Renting or something. But when someone is renting or buying it will say Buyer/Renter then their name on a different sign.

Now for Token Enchants

You right click the sign to upgrade your weapon with coins

Efficiency (1 per upgrade)
Fortune  (1 per upgrade)
Explosion (explodes a radius when more upgrades bigger radius per mine)
The pickaxe cannot break

Crates:
The only way you can get crates are by voting, donating.
Their are different crates that we will make but their is voting crate that you get when you vote, but to open crate you need crate keys. You get crate key by voting, or by buying a rank which gives you several crate keys desired from what rank. So each rank has their own crate. So to create crates, when you right click the crate with the key in your hand it opens, if you left click it it will show you what you can win with the %. To make a crate it can be made in config or in game by saying what you get, run commands and you tell the %.

Crate commands:
 /crate keys give [playername] [amount]	(eco)
 /crate keys take [playername] [amount]        (eco)
 /crates opens a gui which shows you your crate keys and you can put one in your inventory.
